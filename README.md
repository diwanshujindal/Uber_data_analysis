# 🚗 Uber Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the **Uber Data Analysis Project**, where we dive into real-world ride-sharing data to uncover trends, insights, and visual patterns using modern data tools. This project uses **publicly available Uber datasets** and showcases a complete **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** workflow, coupled with interactive dashboards and visualizations.

---

## 📊 Project Objective

To explore, clean, analyze, and visualize Uber ride data in order to derive actionable insights into user behavior, ride trends, and temporal patterns — all while demonstrating the end-to-end capabilities of **MAGE**, **Google Colab**, and **Matplotlib**.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used

- **MAGE**: For orchestrating and managing the ETL pipeline
- **Google Colab**: For collaborative data analysis and notebook execution
- **Matplotlib**: For creating compelling visualizations and dashboards
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and transformation
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations
- **Public Uber Dataset**: For real-world data exploration

## 🔄 ETL Process

1. **Extract**  
   - Loaded raw Uber ride data from public sources into the environment via Google Colab.

2. **Transform**  
   - Cleaned missing or invalid data entries
   - Parsed date-time fields
   - Aggregated ride counts by day, time, and location
   - Created new derived features such as peak hours, ride frequency, etc.

3. **Load**  
   - Final datasets prepared and exported for visualization
   - Pipelines managed using **MAGE** for reproducibility

---

## 📈 Visualizations & Dashboard Highlights

- Ride distribution by **hour of day**
- Monthly ride trends
- Heatmaps showing **pickup intensity** across NYC
- Bar charts comparing ride volume across **weekdays vs weekends**

All visualizations are created using **Matplotlib** and are included in the `dashboards/` folder.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/uber-data-analysis.git
   cd uber-data-analysis
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Launch the Colab notebook from the notebooks/ folder:
Open the notebook in Google Colab
Run cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis
(Optional) Run the MAGE ETL pipeline:
Ensure MAGE is set up and configured
Execute the pipeline to regenerate processed datasets
